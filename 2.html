                In Celestia, the trio marveled at floating palaces and met Lysander, the Eternal Bard. His harp played melodies that spun time backward. He greeted them with a flourish.
“Ah, the Earthlings!” Lysander exclaimed. “To retrieve the Scepter, you must first deliver a piece of the lost sigil to each immortal court.”

	
	Zephyrus, the Wind Lord, resided in a castle of gossamer. His laughter rustled leaves and carried whispers. He demanded a feather from the rarest bird—the Zephyr Sparrow.
Seraphina climbed to the highest peak, where the sparrow nested. It sang: 
Feathers of dawn, secrets unfold, Zephyr’s breath, a tale untold.
	But the sparrow was no ordinary bird. Its wings shimmered like opals, and its song wove threads of wind. It challenged Seraphina:
	“Answer my riddle, seeker of the Scepter. What flies without wings, yet carries dreams across the sky?”
Seraphina pondered. “A cloud,” she replied, and the sparrow’s eyes glimmered with approval. It gifted her a feather—a quill that whispered forgotten winds.
	
	Aurora, the Lightweaver, wove constellations into tapestries. She sought a shard of the Dawn Crystal, lost in the Milky Way.
	Archibald navigated star maps, deciphering celestial runes. The shard whispered: 
In the cosmic loom, threads align, Aurora weaves dreams, divine.
	But the Milky Way was a labyrinth of stardust, and the Dawn Crystal lay hidden within a comet’s tail. Aurora challenged Archibald:
	“What sparkles in the night, yet cradles ancient fire? Seek the comet’s heart.”
	Archibald’s quill danced across parchment, mapping trajectories. When the comet blazed across the sky, he captured the shard—a gem that held the memory of dawn.
	
	Nocturne, the Moon Whisperer, dwelled in a moonstone tower. She desired a moonflower petal, blooming only during lunar eclipses.
	Evie tiptoed through moonlit gardens, plucking the petal. It murmured: 
Moon’s kiss, secrets kept, Nocturne’s heart, forever swept.
	But Nocturne was a cryptic sorceress. She challenged Evie:
	“What blooms in darkness, yet craves the sun’s touch? Speak its name.”
	Evie hesitated. “A shadow,” she whispered, and Nocturne’s eyes glimmered like moonstone. The petal transformed—a key to the moonstone tower.
	The Celestial Ball:
	The three presented their sigil fragments at the Celestial Ball, where immortals waltzed beneath constellations. Lysander played his harp, and the dance floor shimmered.
	Seraphina twirled with Zephyrus, his laughter like wind chimes. “Your courage,” he said, “is a tempest.”
	Archibald debated philosophy with Aurora, her eyes reflecting galaxies. “Your wit,” she whispered, “is a comet’s tail.”
	Evie danced with Nocturne, their steps echoing moon phases. “Your caution,” Nocturne murmured, “is a lunar eclipse.”
And as the ball reached its crescendo, the Scepter pulsed—a convergence of wind, light, and moon. The immortals watched, their eyes filled with wonder.
